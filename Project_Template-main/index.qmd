# CASA00025 Group Project: Assessing the Impact of the Photovoltaic Heat Island Effect on Fish Farms in Southeastern Taiwan

## Project Summary 

Ian I don’t think we are meant to have any text in this section!!
Original:
In line with Net Zero 2050, the Taiwanese government has implemented an aquavoltaics (fishery–electricity symbiosis) policy in southeastern Taiwan since 2020. This initiative integrates solar panels into fish farms to generate renewable energy. However, concerns have arisen about potential environmental impacts, including the photovoltaic heat island (PVHI) effect. While some research suggests PVHI is minimal or even cooling in some areas (Xu et al., 2024), other studies report significant heat island effects of large solar power plants (Barron-Gafford et al., 2016). This project employs remote sensing (landset8?) and solar panel polygon data, using the XXX method, to assess PVHI impacts and compare conditions before and after policy implementation.

### Problem Statement 
What is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?

Potential new paragraph? Needs cutting by 13 words
Although renewable energy is crucial to meeting Taiwan’s Net Zero goals, land availability represents a critical constraint (Hsiao *et al.*, 2021). To address this, the Taiwanese government has implemented an aquavoltaics programme, integrating solar panels into fish farms to generate space-efficient energy. However, this initiative faces significant local opposition, with some authorities even banning construction due to concerns about socio-environmental impacts such as the photovoltaic heat island effect (PHVI). Academic assessments of PHVI find mixed results (Barron-Gafford et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2024). As such, there is a clear need for an accessible, evidence-based participatory planning tool to resolve local conflicts, overcome planning roadblocks, and provide a foundation for informed programme expansion.

Ian’s original:
The main issue lies in the implementation of the aquavoltaics policy by Taiwan’s central government, which provides subsidies to fish farm landowners willing to install solar panels. However, from the perspective of local governments, the excessive installation of solar panels may lead to environmental concerns. Local residents are also worried about the potential heat island effect. Therefore, this project aims to assess the impact of solar panels on temperature through remote sensing analysis, and to develop a visual tool that allows both government authorities and local communities to better understand the environmental effects after solar panel installation.

### End User 
Who are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?

Ian’s original:
This application is being developed for two key groups: local communities in southeastern Taiwan, particularly fish farm landowners and residents, and government authorities involved in the planning and oversight of aquavoltaics projects. Currently, there is a lack of accessible tools for understanding how solar installations affect local microclimates.

Potential alternative? Needs cutting by 4 words
This application serves as a participatory planning tool to overcome conflicts between stakeholders with opposing perspectives on aquavoltaic expansion. It answers the question: What are the PHVI impacts of past solar farms, and what would the impact be in prospective future sites? Alongside expediting planning, helping mitigate local impacts, and supporting Taiwan’s Net Zero goals, additional benefits for each stakeholder are outlined below:

- **National government:** communicating policy; mitigating unfounded concerns.
- **Local government:** evidence-based assessment of past projects; informed future planning within jurisdictions.
- **Fish farmers:** presenting a case for having solar panels installed on their sites.
- **Local residents:** reducing concerns; empowering them to challenge decisions at higher governance levels.

This application serves as a participatory planning tool to overcome conflicts between stakeholders with opposing perspectives on aquavoltaic expansion. It seeks to explore the PHVI impacts of past and prospective solar farms sites. Alongside expediting planning, helping mitigate local impacts, and supporting Taiwan’s Net Zero goals, additional benefits for each stakeholder are outlined below:

- **National government:** communicating policy; mitigating unfounded concerns.
- **Local government:** evidence-based assessment of past projects; informed future planning within jurisdictions.

### Data
What data are you using?
1. Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS imagery at X resolution for temperature change assessments.
2. Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution for fish farm identification.
3. Solar panel polygons and construction dates from the [Taiwanese Civil Service.](https://github.com/kiang/moeaea.gov.tw). 
4. Population estimates at 30m resolution from [Meta’s Data for Good](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps)
5. Digital elevation data at 30m resolution from the [NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003)


### Methodology
How are you using this data to address the problem?

The application first assesses the PHVI impacts of past solar panel sites before predicting implications of future developments. First, land surface temperature (LST) before and after solar panel installation is calculated using the method detailed by Xu *et al.,* (2024), which XXX. A random forest model uses these changes, alongside optical and thermal imagery, slope, and elevation to predict temperature impacts at other sites. A second random forest identifies fish farms, ensuring users can only select prospective sites which could be included in the programme. Finally, predicted temperature change and local population estimates indicate the impact of developments on local communities.

### Interface
How does your application's interface work to address the needs of your end user?

Someone (probably Ian/Sam) needs to fill this in!
Potential points:
Colouring panels by temp change: blue -> white -> red: clearly communicates impact
Summary statistics and bar chart: clear overview
Selecting specific panels, predicting new sites - makes more site specific for a variety of individuals regardless of where they live, enabling them to meet their goals

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

### Analysis

#### Data Processing

Jin to add temperature change stuff! Please also mention that we keep NDVI, NBDI, and optical/thermal bands (excluding B8 and B9) for the random forest. Please keep it short - 50ish words maybe?

Given local government and resident concerns about PHVI’s impact on surrounding communities, we define a function called popBuffer to sum estimated populations within 730 metres of solar farms: a distance typically affected by PHVI (Guoqing *et al.,* 2021).

```js
//Load population from Data For Good
var HRSL_total = ee.ImageCollection('projects/sat-io/open-datasets/hrsl/hrslpop').filterBounds(taiwan).median();

//Vulnerable population: sum of 0-5 and 60+
var HRSL_0_5 = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/hrsl/hrsl_children_under_five").filterBounds(taiwan).median();
var HRSL_60plus = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/hrsl/hrsl_elderly_over_sixty").filterBounds(taiwan).median();
var HRSL_vulnerable = HRSL_0_5.add(HRSL_60plus).rename('HRSL_vulnerable');

//Calculate population within 730m buffer
function popBuffer(panel) {
  var geom = panel.geometry().buffer(730);
  var totalPop = ee.Number(HRSL_total.reduceRegion({reducer: ee.Reducer.sum(), geometry: geom, scale: 30, maxPixels: 1e13}).get('b1')).round();
  var vulnerablePop = ee.Number(HRSL_vulnerable.reduceRegion({reducer: ee.Reducer.sum(), geometry: geom, scale: 30, maxPixels: 1e13}).get('HRSL_vulnerable')).round();
  return panel.set({'total_buffer_pop': totalPop, 'vulnerable_buffer_pop': vulnerablePop});
}
var all_results = results.map(popBuffer);
```

Finally, due to their impact on LST (Šafanda, 1999), we load slope and elevation data and reduce these to the means for each solar polygon. We also calculate polygon areas in hectares squared.

```js
//Add extra non-Landsat features: elevation, topography, and polygon area
var srtm = ee.Image('USGS/SRTMGL1_003').clip(taiwan);
var elevation = srtm.select('elevation');
var slope = ee.Terrain.slope(srtm);

var allFeatures = validFeatures.map(function(feature) {
  var geom = feature.geometry();
  var meanElevation = elevation.reduceRegion({reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(), geometry: geom, scale: 30, maxPixels: 1e13}).get('elevation');
  var meanSlope = slope.reduceRegion({reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(), geometry: geom, scale: 30, maxPixels: 1e13}).get('slope');
  var area = geom.area().divide(10000); //converting to ha^2 as metres were overwhelming the model
  return feature.set({
    'elevation': meanElevation,
    'slope': meanSlope,
    'area': area});
});
```

#### Modelling

After filtering all polygons to ensure they contain the necessary data, variables were extracted to conduct principal component analysis in Python to reduce dimensionality and prevent multicollinearity. The resultant random forest model is trained on 70% of the polygons, and has an R^2 of 0.79. It has a low RMSE and MAE relative to the average temperature change, making it suitable for predicting changes in new sites.

```js
//Extract training data
var bands = test.select(['mean_preLST', 'mean_postLST', 'mean_LST_diff', 'NDVI', 'NDBI', 'FV', 'EM', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7', 'B10', 'B11', 'elevation', 'slope', 'area'])
  .randomColumn();

//Define test-train split
var split=0.7
var training_sample = bands.filter(ee.Filter.lt('random', split));
var validation_sample = bands.filter(ee.Filter.gte('random', split));

print('Sample training feature:', training_sample.first())

//Set up RF
var model = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(100)
  .setOutputMode('REGRESSION')
  .train({
    features: training_sample,
    classProperty: 'mean_postLST',
    //removed mean_preLST, EM, FV due to multicollinearity
    inputProperties: ['NDVI', 'NDBI', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7', 'B10', 'B11', 'elevation', 'slope', 'area']});
```

Cerys to add brief description of method and code

118 words (lmk if it needs cutting)
Importantly, if users are to select potential sites for aquavoltaic programme expansion, it is imperative that these are actually fish farms. We used a Random Forest model to identify existing fish farms based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The analysis draws from Ballinger’s (2024) informal oil refinery identification application. The model is trained and tested on manually drawn land identification polygons. The resulting prediction data was then exported and uploaded to QGIS where it was manually cleaned. In the prediction tab of the final application, the user’s polygon selection is required to intersect with the fish farm polygons. While the model is not perfectly accurate, it is sufficient in its goal of limiting user input to areas with fish farms.

```js

// pre-process imagery
var start='2021-04-14';
var end='2025-04-14';
var bands = ['B2', 'B3', 'B4','B5','B6','B7','B8', 'B8A','B11','B12'];

var sentinel = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED')
                  .filter(ee.Filter.date(start, end))
                  .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 10))
                  .mean()
                  .select(bands);
                
var s_rgb = {
  min: 0.0,
  max: 3000,
  bands:['B4', 'B3', 'B2'],
  opacity:1
};

var sentinel1 = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')
  .filterBounds(AOI)
  .filterDate(start, end)
  .filter(ee.Filter.listContains('transmitterReceiverPolarisation', 'VV'))
  .select('VV')
  .mean();

var ndvi=sentinel.normalizedDifference(['B8','B4']).select(['nd'],['ndvi']);

var ndwi=sentinel.normalizedDifference(['B3','B8']).select(['nd'],['ndwi'])

var newBands = ee.Image([ndwi,ndvi,sentinel1.rename('S1_VV')]);

var image=sentinel.addBands(newBands).clip(AOI);

// add AOI and satellite imagery to map
Map.addLayer(image.clip(AOI), s_rgb, 'Sentinel');
Map.addLayer(AOI,null,"AOI",false);

// select random points from each land type for training/validation
var fishfarm_points=ee.FeatureCollection.randomPoints(fishfarms, 3000).map(function(i){
  return i.set({'class': 0})});
  
var urban_points=ee.FeatureCollection.randomPoints(urban, 1000).map(function(i){
  return i.set({'class': 1})});

  
var river_points=ee.FeatureCollection.randomPoints(rivers, 2000).map(function(i){
  return i.set({'class': 2})});  

var sample=ee.FeatureCollection([urban_points,
                                  fishfarm_points,
                                  river_points
                                  ])
                                  .flatten()
                                  .randomColumn();

// take samples from image for training and validation   
var split=0.7
var training_sample = sample.filter(ee.Filter.lt('random', split));
var validation_sample = sample.filter(ee.Filter.gte('random', split));

var training = image.sampleRegions({
  collection: training_sample,
  properties: ['class'],
  scale: 10,
});

var validation = image.sampleRegions({
  collection: validation_sample,
  properties: ['class'],
  scale: 10
});

// create model and run to create predictions
var model = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(400)
.train(training, 'class');

var prediction = image.classify(model);

var fishfarm_prediction=prediction.updateMask(prediction.eq(0));

Map.addLayer(fishfarm_prediction,{palette:'red'},'Predicted Fish Farms');

// Assess accuracy of model
var validated = validation.classify(model);

var testAccuracy = validated.errorMatrix('class', 'classification');

print('Confusion Matrix ', testAccuracy);
print('Validation overall accuracy: ', testAccuracy.accuracy())

```
